# What we will build
We want to build an app that exposes an endpoint where the user can send his Height and weight; the function will calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) and return the result. The endpoint will accept POST requests.

# create a Lambda function with the Java Runtime, Add an API Gateway in front to invoke the function through an endpoint.
